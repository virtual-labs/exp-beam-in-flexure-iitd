<h4>Terminology</h4><br>
The following symbols are used in the experiment -

L’ = overall length of the beam 
 
L	= length of the beam between outer supports 
 
b	= width of the beam 
 
D	= depth of the beam 
 
d	= effective depth of the beam 
 
A<sub>st</sub> 	= area of steel in tension 
 
I<sub>gs</sub>	= moment of inertia considering gross section 
 
I<sub>ts</sub>	= moment of inertia considering transformed section 
 
f<sub>ym</sub>	= mean yield strength of steel 
 
f<sub>cm</sub>	= mean compressive strength of concrete 
 
f<sub>cr</sub>	= flexural strength of concrete 
 
E<sub>s</sub>	= elastic modulus of steel (around 200GPa)
 
E<sub>c</sub>	= elastic modulus of concrete (=5000√f<sub>cm</sub>) 

m	= modular ratio (E<sub>s</sub>/E<sub>c</sub>) 

P	= applied load 

M	= bending moment because of applied load 

y	= depth of centroidal axis 

x<sub>u</sub>	= depth of neutral axis

<h4>Behaviour of Flexure Members</h4>
<br>
Structural elements like beams and slabs frequently experience flexure or bending when they are transversely loaded. Columns and walls that experience eccentric stress, lateral pressures, and/or lateral displacements also encounter flexure. Flexure typically happens in combination with transverse shear, though it can also happen with torsion and axial compression, among other structural actions. In this experiment, the behaviour of an UR beam subjected to pure flexure is studied. Pure flexure condition in achieved using a four-point loading setup and is discussed late
Beams are divided into two categories based on the presence of tension and compression steel -

<br>
<ol>
<li>Singly Reinforced Beam ( see Fig. 1 (A) ) 
<br>
The beam section that has steel only on the tension side is known as singly reinforced beam.
</li>
<li>
Doubly Reinforced Beam ( see Fig. 2 (B) )
The beam section that has steel on the tension as well as compression side is known as a doubly reinforced beam.
</li>
</ol>

Based on area of tension steel, the beam section is divided into three categories -
<ol>
<li>Balanced Section : The area of tension steel is such that the two limiting conditions (yielding of steel and crushing of concrete) are reached simultaneously. </li>
<li>Under Reinforced (UR) Section: The area of tension steel is such that the beam fails by yielding of tension steel followed by crushing of concrete. </li>
<li>Over Reinforced (OR) Section: The area of tension steel is such that the beam fails due to crushing of concrete.
</li>
</ol>
<br>

<br>
The moment at which the first crack appears in a beam is known as the "cracking moment" of the beam section(M<sub>cr</sub>).

OR beams experience a sudden brittle failure due to crushing of concrete. The moment at which crushing of concrete takes place and the beam experiences a sudden failure is known as the “Ultimate Moment of failure(M<sub>ur</sub>)” for an OR beam section. Fig(A) represents the moment-curvature curve for an OR beam section.

UR beams failure also occur due to crushing of concrete. This crushing is achieved after yielding of tension steel. The moment at which tension steel yields, is known as the yielding moment of an UR beam. The maximum moment that a beam can withhold, before its failure due to crushing of concrete is known as Ultimate moment of failure of an UR beam. Fig(A) represents the moment-curvature curve for an UR beam section.

<h4>Analysis of an UR Section</h4>
<br>
<ol>
<li><b>Uncracked Phase in an UR section</b>
<br>
This phase has extremely small loads. In this phase, concrete can carry tensile forces. Stress strain curves of concrete are linear in nature in this phase
